ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a pharmacist interested in becoming a software engineer. My current interest is in web development but I anticipate growth in other areas as well. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and javascript.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching anime! Haha~ 

My github profile is small for now but just watch +_+ <i>it will grow</i>.
You can also find my journey on <a href="https://twitter.com/Koulight44">Twitter</a>.
