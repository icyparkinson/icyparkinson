ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am a pharmacist and a software engineer. My current interest is in web development but I anticipate growth in other areas as well. 

ðŸŒ± My current focus is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching anime! Haha~ 

You can also find my journey on <a href="https://twitter.com/Koulight44">Twitter</a>.
